# Feast Feature Store Configuration - Simple Local Setup
# SQLite for registry, online store, and file-based offline store

project: sales_demand_forecasting

# SQLite registry (local file-based)
registry: /shared/feature_repo/data/feast_registry.db

provider: local

# SQLite online store for real-time inference
online_store:
  type: sqlite
  path: /shared/feature_repo/data/online_store.db

# File-based offline store (simple, no Ray)
offline_store:
  type: file

entity_key_serialization_version: 3


# For production deployments with high concurrency requirements, you can use:
# - PostgreSQL for the registry (instead of SQLite)
# - Ray for distributed offline store (instead of file-based)
#
# However, for most use cases, the simple SQLite + file-based setup above is sufficient.
# The training script uses direct parquet loading which bypasses Feast for speed.
#
# # PostgreSQL registry example:
# # registry:
# #   registry_type: sql
# #   path: postgresql+psycopg2://feast:<password>@feast-postgres.<your-namespace>.svc.cluster.local:5432/feast_registry
# #   cache_ttl_seconds: 60
#
# # Ray offline store example:
# # offline_store:
# #   type: ray
# #   storage_path: /shared/models/feast_ray_storage
